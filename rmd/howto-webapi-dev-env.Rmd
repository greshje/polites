<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This document will walk you through setting up a development environment for WebAPI and Atlas development. 
  This will include:
  <ul>
    <li>Downloading and installing dependent software and tools</li>
    <li>Forking the projects from Github</li>
    <li>Running and debuging the applications in your IDE</li>
    <li>Committing your updated code back up to Github</li>
    <li>Creating a pull request</li>
  </ul>
  The environment created here will sit on top of Broadsea. 
  The environment created here will use Eclipse as an IDE. 
</p>

<h2>Installations</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Downloading and installing of the the underlying dependent software is described in detail in the 
  <a href="./quick-start.html">Quickstart Guide</a>. 
  All of the underlying software required for your development environment will be installed by following these instructions. 
  The process consists of basically downloading and running an installer 
  and then running a couple of installers that could not be automated. 
  Details on exactly what software is installed can be found in the Prerequisites section of the  
  <a href="./introduction.html">Introduction</a> documentation.
