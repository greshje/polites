<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This document will walk you through setting up a development environment for WebAPI and Atlas development. 
  This will include:
  <ul>
    <li>Downloading and installing dependent software and tools</li>
    <li>Forking the projects from Github</li>
    <li>Running and debuging the applications in your IDE</li>
    <li>Committing your updated code back up to Github</li>
    <li>Creating a pull request</li>
  </ul>
  The environment created here will sit on top of Broadsea. 
  The environment created here will use Eclipse as an IDE. 
</p>

<!--

* Installations

<h2>Installations</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Downloading and installing of the the underlying dependent software is described in detail in the 
  <a href="./quick-start.html">Quickstart Guide</a> (The Run section at the very end of the document can be skipped). 
  All of the underlying software required for your development environment will be installed by following these instructions,
  except for the IDE. The IDE will be installed separately.
  In this case Eclipse will be used as described below.
  The process consists of basically downloading and running an installer 
  and then running a couple of installers that could not be automated. 
  Details on exactly what software is installed can be found in the Prerequisites section of the
  <a href="./introduction.html">Introduction</a> documentation.

* Fork

<h2>Fork WebAPI</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In order to manage our changes and keep them as isolated as possible we will be forking and branching our code.
  Forking means creating a copy of a repository in another users account.
  Branching means creating a copy of the code base in the same repository.
  To create a fork of the WebAPI project, log in to your personal Github account and navigate to 
  <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/WebApi">https://github.com/OHDSI/WebApi</a>.
  In the upper right corner, select "fork" and then "create new fork". 
  <br/>
  <img src="./img/dev-env/fork.png" />
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If we now go back to our own account and repositories, we should see a copy of WebAPI. 
  <br/>
  <img src="./img/dev-env/forked.png" />
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We can now create the branch we are going to work in by navigating to our fork of the repository 
  (for me this is https://github.com/greshje/WebAPI)
  and then selecting the branches dropdown, entering the name of the branch we want to create,
  and then selecting Create Branch as shown below.
  <br/>
  <img src="./img/dev-env/create-branch.png" />
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Next we clone our fork of the repository and checkout the branch we've created
  by opening a cmd window, navigating to our workspace folder and executing the commands shown below.
  (be sure to use the url for your fork, i.e. your personal github account)
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
git clone https://github.com/greshje/WebAPI
cd WebAPI
git checkout gresh-test-2024-10-13
</pre>
<img src="./img/dev-env/clone.png" />

<!--

* Open in Eclipse

<h2>Open in Eclipse</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  An instance of Eclipse is included in the _YES_POLITES installation.
  Open Eclipse by executing C:\\_YES_POLITES\\eclipse\\eclipse.exe (use the default workspace).
  Import the WebAPI project by right clicking on the Navigator pain and selecting import...
  <br/>
  <img src="./img/dev-env/import.png" />
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Select Maven->Existing Maven Projects.
  <br/>
  <img src="./img/dev-env/select-existing.png" />
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Navigate to the C:\\_YES_POLITES\\workspace\\WebAPI folder.
